# ABSTRACT: Base class for a system


=head1 NAME

Salvation::System - Base class for a system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package YourSystem;

 use Moose;

 extends 'Salvation::System';

 no Moose;

=head1 REQUIRES

L<Carp> 

L<Moose> 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Applied roles

L<Salvation::Roles::SharedStorage>

L<Salvation::Roles::AppArgs>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 To be called

=head3 start

 $system_instance -> start();

A method which really starts the system and returns the output of the whole process.

=head3 stop

 $self -> stop();

A method which interrupts the system immediately.

=head3 run_service

 $self -> run_service( $absolute_package_name );
 $self -> run_service( $absolute_package_name, @service_constructor_args );

A method which runs the full cycle of the given service and returns appropriate L<Salvation::Service::State> if run was successfull.

=head3 Service

 $self -> Service( $relative_package_name );
 $self -> Service( $relative_package_name, \%flags );

Add a service with C<$name> to the list of system's services.

You can use C<\%flags> to do some tweaking providing following keys:

=over

=item transform_name

A CodeRef which will be called in order to change service's name.

 transform_name => sub
 {
 	my ( $system_instance, $service_name ) = @_;

	$service_name =~ s/MattSmith/DavidTennant/g;

	return $service_name;
 }

Useful when you feel especially crutchy.

=item constraint

A CodeRef which will be called in order to check whether the service needs to be run, or not. Should return boolean value.

 constraint => sub
 {
 	my ( $system_instance, $service_name ) = @_;

	return ( int( rand( 2 ) ) == 1 );
 }

=back

=head3 Fatal

 $self -> Fatal( @anything );

Add C<@anything> to the list of fatal errors.
The thing will C<die> with this list in the end.

=head2 To be redefined

You can redefine following methods to achieve your own goals.

=head3 main

Very first method to be executed in the execution flow.
The only argument is C<$self> which is current system's instance.

Its return value is the return value of C<Salvation::System::start>.
